# Mindfulness Activity App

## Overview

The Mindfulness Activity App is designed to help users engage in three distinct mindfulness activities: Breathing, Listening, and Reflection. These activities aim to promote mental well-being and encourage mindfulness through reflection, deep breathing, and focused listening.

This app demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C#, such as Abstraction, Inheritance, and Encapsulation. Each activity is implemented as a class that extends a base `Activity` class, providing reflective prompts and inspirational Bible quotes.

### 3. Listing Activity

The Listing Activity enhances mindfulness by encouraging users to focus on the sounds around them and reflect on what they hear.

**Example Outputs:**

## Code Implementation

The app is built in **C#** and employs a modular design with a base `Activity` class extended by specific activity classes (`BreathingActivity`, `ReflectionActivity`, and `ListingActivity`). Each class encapsulates the logic and prompts for its respective mindfulness activity.
