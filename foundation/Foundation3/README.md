# Exercise Tracking App

## Description

The **Exercise Tracking App** is a console application that demonstrates tracking and calculating activity data for running, cycling, and swimming. The app automatically generates summaries for each activity type, calculating distance, speed, and pace, and outputs the data in a readable format. It also exports the activity summaries to a text file.

## Features

- Tracks three types of activities: Running, Cycling, Swimming
- Automatically calculates:
  - Distance (in kilometers)
  - Speed (in kilometers per hour)
  - Pace (minutes per kilometer)
- Displays activity summaries
- Provides a distance graph for each activity
- Exports activity summaries to a text file

## How It Works

- The program creates instances of activities (Running, Cycling, Swimming) with predefined data (date, duration, distance, etc.).
- It calculates various metrics like speed, distance, and pace based on the activity type.
- Displays the total time, distance, and average speed for all activities.
- Outputs a graphical representation of the distance for each activity.
- All results are saved to a text file (`activities_summary.txt`).
